Welcome to pyDNA-EPBD's documentation!
======================================
This repository corresponds to the article titled as **pyDNA-EPBD: A Python-based Implementation of the Extended Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois Model for DNA Breathing Dynamics Simulation**.

**Background:** The dynamic behavior of DNA sequences, including local transient openings or *breathing* and flipping, is crucial in a wide range of biological processes and genomic disorders. However, accurate modeling and simulation of these phenomena, particularly for homogeneous and periodic DNA sequences, have remained a challenge due to the complex interplay of factors such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and base stacking.

**Results:** To address this, we have developed pyDNA-EPBD, a Python-based software tool that employs an extended version of the Peyrard–Bishop–Dauxois (EPBD) model. This extension integrates a sequence-dependent stacking term, enabling a more precise description of the DNA melting behavior for homogenous and periodic sequences. Through the use of a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach, pyDNA-EPBD simulates DNA dynamics and generates data on DNA breathing characteristics such as bubble coordinates and flipping.

**Conclusions:** The introduction of pyDNA-EPBD presents a significant advancement in the field of genomics and genetics, providing a powerful tool for the analysis and prediction of DNA dynamics. By facilitating a deeper understanding of key genomic regions such as CpG islands and disease-related repeats, this software can contribute to advancing our knowledge of DNA behavior and its implications in genomic anomalies.
